A good commit message header

There is a blank line between the header and rest of the body. We also
make sure we don't go beyond the 72 character limit.

- We can also support lists
- just make sure we have a space between
- either a hyphen or asterisk

Here's another paragraph. We can also have more than one.

* asterisks are allowed
* for lists
